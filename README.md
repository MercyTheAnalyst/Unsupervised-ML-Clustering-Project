# Unsupervised-ML-Clustering-Project
The problem statement was to understand Target Customers needed for marketing team to plan a strategy. 
In this project, exploratory data analysis was performed and segmentation of customer groups was achieved. 

The data contain 200 datasets with CustomerID, Age, Gender, Annual Income (k$) and Spending Score (1-100) features. 

First, Univariate analysis was performed on the dataset using each feature to visualize how the data spread across 
the mean using Distribution plot. Also, the relationship between the Gender was visualized using the Kernel Distribution
Estimation (KDE) Plot as well as Boxplot. Similarly, Bivariate analysis was performed on the dataset using Annual Income
(k$) and Spending Score (1-100). The correlation was further visualized between Age, Annual Income (k$) and Spending Score
(1-100) using Pair Plot, and Heatmap.

Univariate, Bivariate and Multivariate Analysis were performed using Clustering Model. KMeans Function was used with 
number of clusters of 3 for the Univariate analysis, 5 for Bivariate analysis and 4 for Multivariate analysis. 

As shown in the attached figure, the Bivariate Analysis with Cluster 2 has the higher number of Annual Income of 86.53(k$)
and Spending Score (1-100) of 82.13. The Target group would therefore, be Cluster 2. Also, the percentage of women that
shop in cluster 2 is 54%. It is recommended that Marketing Campaigns that would help attract women should be launched in 
this cluster with focus on popular items. 

Likewise, Cluster 3 unfolds interesting and amazing opportunity that waits to be exploits. This is because it has Annual
Income of 26(k$) but high Spending Score (1-100) of 79. This offers a medium to market to customers for sales on popular
items as well.
